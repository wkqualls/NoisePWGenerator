# NoisePWGenerator
This application will generate a safe random password based on the parameters you select.  The password can be any length from 8 to 128 characters and can include uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and a selection of special characters.  If you select multiple types, it will randomly choose an applicable character of each in a set pattern up to the requested password length. For example, if you select 8 characters and all types, the password might be Px1&Ke2=.  It will cut the pattern short if it reaches the requested length.
The "Noise" in the title is a tongue-in-cheek reference to the nonsensical (but secure) passwords this approach tends to create.
